//! Agents do not move across open ground toward a bearing; they move along the

//! kept in [`scenario::vectors`]. An engine and a family car are confined to
//! drivable ways; a person on foot can also use tracks, paths and steps.
//!
//! Routing is deliberately **not** per-agent pathfinding. Every agent wants
//! the same thing -- the nearest reachable refuge -- so one multi-source
//! Dijkstra from all refuges gives every node in the network its distance to
//! safety and its next hop toward it. That is a single graph search per
//! refresh instead of 750, and it makes rerouting around a road the fire has
//! cut a property of the field rather than something each agent has to
//! discover. Two fields are kept, because the two travel modes see different
//! graphs.
