//! «Dove andrà il fuoco»: the scientific expert's forecast, issued at each
//! pause (docs/01-GIOCO.md §2, user 2026-10-14).
//!
//! What it knows is what the player could know: the fire **now** (the core's
//! own state, [`fire::ensemble::Snapshot`]), the wind now, and the weather
//! bulletin: the case's change of wind, if it is still to come. Nothing else
//! the simulation will do is read.
//!
//! [`MEMBERS`] runs of the same propagator go forward [`HORIZONS_S`], each
//! with its own seed and a wind perturbed around the forecast: the wind now
//! by ±[`NOW_DIR_DEG`] and ±[`NOW_SPEED`], the announced wind by
//! ±[`LATER_DIR_DEG`] and ±[`LATER_SPEED`], its time by ±[`LATER_AT_S`].
//! **Senza interventi**: the members carry the lines already cut and the
//! water already dropped, but no crew works in them from now on, so the
//! forecast is pessimistic where the units are working. Per cell, the share
//! of members in which it has burnt by +1 and +3 h; the 50 % contour
//! is the isochrone the map draws.
//!
//! Deterministic: the members' seeds and winds come from the game's seed and
//! the time of issue only.
