//! Buildings, extruded from their real OSM footprints.
//!
//! Every one of the 7,629 footprints in the window is drawn as actual
//! geometry: walls following the traced outline, an overhanging eave, and a
//! hipped or flat roof depending on what the building is. That matters beyond
//! looks. The player is asked to judge which streets are defensible and where
//! a fire can run into the town, and a field of identical boxes hides exactly
//! the things that decision turns on — how tightly packed the old centre is,
//! how the ridge-line houses stand alone in the fuel, where the industrial
//! sheds are.
//!
//! Heights come from data where there is data. OSM `building:levels` is
//! present on very few of these, so the storey count baked into the population
//! file is used where a dwelling exists, and otherwise a height is inferred
//! from the building's tag and footprint area. That inference is visible and
//! wrong in individual cases; it is not used by any model, only drawn.
//!
//! Colour is per-building, hashed from the OSM id off a Ligurian palette —
//! ochre, terracotta, cream, faded rose — so the town reads as a town rather
//! than as one material. The palette is the point where this stops being
//! documentation of data and starts being art direction, and it is confined to
//! [`palette`] so it can be replaced wholesale.
//!
//! Geometry is merged per 512 m chunk, the same trade [`crate::vegetation`]
//! makes: 7,629 entities would cost more in transform propagation and draw
//! calls than the triangles do, while chunks still cull.
//!
//! Buildings respond to the fire through [`fire::StructureExposure`], never
//! through the fire mask — a house sits on a non-burnable cell and can never
//! appear in it (see `fire::exposure`). A structure the exposure model has
//! ignited flares, then goes to charcoal.
