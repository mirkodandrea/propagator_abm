//! Map overlays for the kiosk: the rule
//! that 3D interface marks cast and take no shadows. The orders' signs are in
//! `kiosk::marks`.
//!
//! Everything sits well above the canopy (finding 13: a correct overlay
//! under the plants is seen never), is unlit and glowing so the bloom pass
//! catches it, and is rebuilt from `Sim` state with no latch of its own — so a
//! restart needs only the key cleared (finding 21).
