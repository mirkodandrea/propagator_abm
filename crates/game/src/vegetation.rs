//! Fuel-driven vegetation using Blender-authored tree and shrub archetypes.
//!
//! The fuel raster is the only vegetation source this scenario has — there is
//! no tree inventory, and there never will be one at 10 km scale — so the
//! plants are generated from it: one archetype per `eu_fuel12` group, scattered
//! deterministically from a hash of the cell they stand in. Deterministic
//! matters more than it sounds: the same seed must produce the same forest on
//! every run, or a debrief replay would show a different landscape than the
//! incident did.
//!
//! The terrain under the plants is bare ground (see [`crate::terrain_mesh`]),
//! so *all* of the land cover a player sees is geometry: grass tussocks and
//! macchia as much as trees. That raises the plant count into the hundreds of
//! thousands, which sets the budget for everything below — each archetype is
//! built to at most 120 vertices, and the visual density comes from crown
//! width and overlap rather than from stem count, because a hundred wide
//! crowns close a canopy that a thousand narrow ones would not.
//!
//! Geometry is merged into per-chunk meshes rather than spawned per plant: one
//! entity each would cost more in transform propagation and draw calls than
//! the triangles themselves, while merged chunks give the renderer a couple of
//! hundred draws for the entire landscape and still allow frustum culling.
//!
//! The plants respond to the fire: each one remembers which fire cell it
//! stands in, and when that cell's state changes the plant is redrawn —
//! foliage flares, then goes to charcoal. Only chunks whose cells actually
//! changed are touched, so the cost tracks the front.
//!
//! The meshes are never modified for that: every vertex carries its plant's
//! index (`materials::ATTRIBUTE_PLANT`), a small per-chunk image holds each
//! plant's state and ignition time, and the vertex stage
//! (`shaders/veg_state.wgsl`) collapses, recolours and flags the plant. A
//! chunk is ~80 k triangles and Bevy clones and uploads a modified mesh whole:
//! rewriting two or three of them every 0.15 s was a frame hitch of tens of
//! milliseconds on both the main and the render thread. `draw_standing`,
//! `draw_char` and `paint` do the same on the CPU: they are the reference for
//! the shader.
//!
//! Every chunk is built twice: with the authored models, and with a proxy of
//! a couple of dozen faces per plant (a faceted crown on a three-sided
//! trunk) that stands in for it beyond [`crate::quality::Graphics::lod_m`].
//! A plant there covers a few pixels, and the GPU — which is what limits the
//! frame rate — draws every vegetation triangle once per pass, shadow
//! cascades included. Both meshes burn together.
