//! Reading the fire as a continuous field instead of as 20 m cells.
//!
//! The CA computes on a 20 m raster, but nothing says the fire has to be
//! *drawn* on one — and if it is, the result looks like a spreadsheet: square
//! flame fronts, staircase scar edges, whole blocks of trees igniting in
//! lockstep. Every renderer here samples the fire through this module instead,
//! which bilinearly interpolates the cell fields and warps the sample position
//! with value noise, so the visible boundary meanders at a scale finer than
//! the grid it came from.
//!
//! This is a rendering device and nothing more: the model is unchanged, and no
//! decision — exposure, intervention, agent behaviour — is ever taken from
//! these interpolated values.
