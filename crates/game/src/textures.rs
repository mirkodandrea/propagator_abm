//! Procedural textures for the fire.
//!
//! Flat quads are what make particle fire look like cardboard: the silhouette
//! is a rectangle and the edges are hard lines. Everything here exists to give
//! the fire soft, irregular edges without shipping any image assets — the
//! textures are generated at startup from value noise, so the whole scenario
//! stays reproducible from code and data alone.
//!
//! All three are alpha masks; colour comes from the mesh's vertex colours, so
//! one texture serves flames of any temperature.
