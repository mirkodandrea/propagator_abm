//! Drawing the suppression units, their orders, and what their work left behind.
//!
//! Three layers, and they answer three different questions the commander asks
//! constantly:
//!
//! - **the units** — where is my engine *now*, and is it working or driving?
//! - **the orders** — what did I tell it to do, and where? A ring at the task
//!   point and, for a hand line, the alignment itself with the cut part drawn
//!   solid and the rest ghosted, so "how far have they got" is a glance.
//! - **the work** — cut line and wetted ground. Without this the suppression
//!   model is invisible: water and fuel removal only ever show up as fire that
//!   *didn't* spread, and a player cannot see a counterfactual.
//!
//! Everything is drawn as a map symbol rather than to scale, for the reason
//! [`crate::people`] spells out: at command altitude a fire engine is a pixel.
//! Same family, same exaggeration, and the [`SYMBOL_SCALE`] knob is deliberately
//! larger than the civilian one — a unit the player has to click on and re-task
//! has to be findable, and there are eight of them against 1,577 people.
//!
//! The one thing worth knowing before editing: the work overlay sits at
//! [`crate::rings::RING_LIFT_M`] above the ground like every other
//! symbol here, *not* on it. Vegetation on this map is 5–15 m of real plants, so
//! a cut line painted on the terrain is rendered perfectly and seen never.
